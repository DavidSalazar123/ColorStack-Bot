## Installation

To add the Discord Bot to your server, you must have the invite link from the National ColorStack Slack as it's a beta release. Don't change any of the permission settings!

If the bot was successfully added, you should see this message within the `opportunities-bot` channel: `Hello! I am the ColorStack Bot. I will be posting new job opportunities here.`

If you don't see the message and the bot has left the server, then you didn't give it the proper permissions, or we are at capacity.

If you believe there is an issue with the bot, please make sure to [create an issue](https://github.com/colorstackatuw/ColorStack-Discord-Bot/issues).
